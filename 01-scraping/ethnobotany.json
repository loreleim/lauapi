[XVIII] Na ‘ulu hua i ka hapapa. The breadfruit that bears on the ground. Breadfruit trees of Ni‘ihau were grown in sinkholes. The trunks were not visible, and the branches seemed to spread along the ground. These trees are famed in chants of Ni‘ihau. [XIX] O ka ‘ulu o lalo he loa‘a i ka pinana, o ka ‘ulu o luna loa he loa‘a i ka lou. A breadfruit that is low can be reached by climbing, but a breadfruit high above requires a stick to reach it.

A konohiki of Ke‘ei in Kona, Hawai‘i, was placed in charge of a fine breadfruit grove. In spite of his watchfulness, the fruit were stolen as soon as they matured. Secretly he asked all of his relatives to help him watch for the culprit. However, some were related to the thief as well, who learned about the watch and evaded capture. Long after, a slip of the tongue revealed the thief. [XXI] Ua pi‘i paha i ka ‘ulu o Maunawili.  Gone up, perhaps, to fetch the breadfruit of Maunawili. A play on wili (twist, turn about).

[II] Pua ka wiliwili nanahu ka mano; pua ka wahine u‘i nanahu ke kanawai. When the wiliwili blooms, the sharks bite; when a beautiful woman blossoms the law bites. A beautiful woman attracts young men, \"sharks\", who fight over her. The law steps in to keep the rivalry from getting out of hand (the law \"bites\"). It is said that the wiliwili blooms during the mating season of sharks, and that is when they will \"bite\". This saying is also part of the Hula Mano.","dyeColorAndParts":":","kinoLau":":","locationOnBishopMuseumKalihiCampus":"in corner of lot","propagationInformation":"Easy.
